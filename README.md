## 🚀 Features & Deliverables

- **End-to-End Sales Analysis:**  
  Clean, explore, and visualize retail sales data to uncover key trends and seasonality.
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Build, evaluate, and compare advanced regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast future sales and income.
- **Key Metrics & KPIs:**  
  Quantify, visualize, and interpret business performance, highlighting monthly and weekly trends.
- **Reproducible Jupyter Notebook:**  
  All code and outputs are documented for clarity and easy reviewer navigation.
- **Business Recommendations:**  
  Data-driven recommendations to boost revenue and optimize operational strategies.
